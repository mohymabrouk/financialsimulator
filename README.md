## 🎯 Educational Objectives

This simulator helps you understand:

- **Option Pricing Theory**: Black-Scholes formula implementation  
- **The Greeks**: Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta behavior  
- **Risk Management**: Delta hedging for market makers  
- **Volatility Impact**: How vol affects option pricing

## 🧪 Learning Exercises

### 🧮 Exercise 1: Greek Sensitivity
Try changing the spot price and observe Delta behavior. Notice how:
- Delta approaches 1.0 for deep ITM calls  
- Delta approaches 0.0 for deep OTM calls

### ⏳ Exercise 2: Time Decay Analysis
Set up an ATM option and monitor Theta:
- Observe accelerating time decay near expiration  
- Compare ATM vs ITM/OTM time decay rates

### 📉 Exercise 3: Volatility Impact Study
Compare option prices at different volatility levels:
- 20% volatility vs 40% volatility  
- Which options show highest Vega sensitivity?

### 🛡️ Exercise 4: Delta Hedging Simulation
Create a short call position and practice hedging:
- Monitor P&L changes with underlying movement  
- Experiment with rebalancing frequencies
